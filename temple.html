                    <p>The Buddha’s first teaching was that of the Four Noble Truths. These teachings provide a succinct observation of the predicament in which we find ourselves - they identify of the cause of our predicament, they offer reassurance that we can liberate ourselves, and they offer a clear and detailed path of how to achieve that liberation.
                        The predicament referred to is that the nature of our ordinary human experience is ultimately unsatisfying. While there are many moments of joy and connection in our lives, our tendency is to grasp at those experiences. This grasping then becomes a source of suffering when those enjoyable experiences pass. Our habitual pattern of grasping and attachment happens on many levels. The root of all the suffering of cyclic existence is attachment to a sense of self as being separate and independently existent. The Four Noble Truths are the gateway for us to begin to recognize and work with this.   
                        In this class, we will explore the traditional teachings of the Four Noble Truths and also see how they directly manifest and are relevant in our 21st century lives. We will examine the many ways, both coarse and subtle, in which we grasp onto our experience and our sense of self, we will look at how we can begin to loosen that grip, and we will envision how we might live our lives in a way that benefits others and supports our spiritual liberation.
                        Each class will include meditation instruction and a silent calm abiding sitting. After presenting teachings, Lama Döndrup will offer a contemplative exercise and class participants will have the opportunity to breakout into small groups to reflect on their experience.
                        No prerequisites needed. We welcome students of all levels to deepen their understand of these essential teachings.</p>
